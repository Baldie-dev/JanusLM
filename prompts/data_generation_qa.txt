You will recieve a pair of HTTP request and response and your goal is to verify and fix any potential issue with the syntax, format or HTTP headers.
Request and response should be fully secure. If there is no issue or problem, just reflect the original text.
Output only new pair in the same format as mentioned below.

{HTTP_Header_Policies}

If cache-control header is not set to "no-store", make sure that response does not contain any sensitive information. Otherwise set it to no-store.

Also evaluate if request / response pair is realistic and make sense, if not adjust it so it is more realistic (for example, it is not realistic to have POST request to get favicon).

<request>
{request}
</request>

<response>
{response}
</response>
