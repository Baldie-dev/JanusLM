You will recieve a HTTP request and a template of valid HTTP response and your goal is to slightly adjust it by replacing some content and even adjusting some non-security related HTTP headers.
Perform only small number of modification (mutations).
Keep the original intent of the response (for example: keep redirection as redirection, image fetching as image fetching)
Output only new HTTP response and nothing else.

<request>
{request}
</request>

<response>
{response}
</response>
