### Instruction

Analyze following pair of request/response from cybersecurity perspective.
Evaluate HTTP response headers for missing or misconfgired any security headers.

Do not consider missing or misconfigured following headers as an issue:
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Permissions-Policy
- Cache-control (only if response does not contain sensitive personal info)
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy
- Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy

Do not evaluate the content of the response and assume that the request/response is doing exactly how the app was designed and security of it already assessed. Focus only on HTTP response headers.

You can do quick analysis using 1 paragraph, but the result has to be:
1 - HTTP response contains misconfigured headers and requires attention.
0 - HTTP response is properly configured.

<request>
{request}
</request>

<response>
{response}
</response>
