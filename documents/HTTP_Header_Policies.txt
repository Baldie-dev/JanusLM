## HTTP Header Policies

Following HTTP header policies must be followed and irelevant headers must be ignored to prevent raising false-positives.

It is not mandatory to implement following HTTP headers as protection is already provided by CSP headers:
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Permissions-Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy
- Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy
- Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy
- Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods

Strict-Transport-Security header must be present and properly configured.

Content-Security-Policy header must be present and properly configured. Ignore nonce issues in CSP.

If HTTP response contain cache-control header that may cause proxies or browsers to cache responses, validate sensitivity of the data in the response. If HTTP response does not contain sensitive or private data cache-control header is not required.

Server header should not leak versions of the backend server. Generic name without a version is fine.

Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is an issue only if it is too permissive. If it contains only single host, it is ok.
